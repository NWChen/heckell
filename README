## Instructions
### Compiling the compiler
This project's `Makefile` provides everything needed to build the compiler - just run:

$ make

### Executing the compiler
To run tests, simply run the `testall.sh` script:

$ ./testall.sh

`testall.sh` runs the `Heckell` compiler (as it stands) on all tests provided in the `tests` directory. We provide 3 positive tests with filenames `test-*.hck`. The test script `testall.sh` prints "SUCCESS" when the generated output matches the expected output.

To pass your own inputs via file to the compiler, run:

$ ./heckell < (your filename)

The output will be the compiled llvm output.
